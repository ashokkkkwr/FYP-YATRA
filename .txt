or a 2-month project timeline, itâ€™s important to focus on core features that can be realistically developed within the timeframe, ensuring quality and functionality. Here's a list of features you could prioritize:

Month 1:
1. Real-Time Public Transport Tracking
Live GPS Tracking: Implement a real-time tracking system for buses, microbuses, and taxis using GPS to display their current locations on a map.
Estimated Arrival Times (ETA): Based on GPS data, calculate and display estimated arrival times at bus stops or stations.
Bus Stop Locator: Implement a feature to help users locate the nearest bus stops based on their current location.
2. Route Planning and Directions
Multi-Route Suggestions: Suggest multiple routes combining different transport options (bus, microbus, walking) to help users reach their destination.
Fare Calculation: Provide an estimated fare calculation for each suggested route based on the distance and type of transport.
3. User Profiles and Ratings
User Profiles: Implement basic profiles for passengers, allowing users to save their details and view their past travel history.
Ratings and Reviews: Allow users to rate their trips, which can later be expanded to rate drivers or public transport services.
4. Real-Time Alerts and Notifications
Transport Availability Alerts: Notify users when a bus or ride-sharing vehicle is approaching their stop or location based on the GPS tracking.
Traffic and Route Updates: Display real-time traffic updates or road closure information that might affect the route.
Month 2:
1. Ticket Booking and Payment Integration
Online Ticket Booking: Allow users to book tickets for long-distance buses and pay using integrated e-wallets like eSewa or Khalti.
Digital Passes and QR Code Tickets: Generate digital passes with QR codes that can be scanned for boarding the bus, reducing the need for paper tickets.
2. Ride-Sharing and Carpooling
Carpooling Feature: Create a feature where users can share rides with others traveling in the same direction, promoting cost-sharing and reducing traffic.
Driver and Passenger Matching: Match drivers and passengers based on their route and time preferences.
3. Safety and Security Features
Driver Verification: Implement a verification system for drivers in the ride-sharing feature, ensuring they meet the required standards.
Live Trip Sharing: Allow users to share their live trip status with friends or family for safety.
4. Real-Time Alerts and Notifications
Fare Surge Alerts: Notify users of any surge in ride-sharing fares due to high demand.
5. Offline Mode
Offline Route Availability: Allow users to download routes and timetables for offline access, especially useful in areas with poor connectivity.
Stretch Features (if time permits):
Environmental Impact Tracking: Provide data on the carbon emissions saved by using public transport or carpooling.
Scheduled Rides: Allow users to schedule rides in advance, especially for regular carpoolers or long-distance trips.
Tools and Technologies:
Frontend: React or Vue.js for interactive UI.
Backend: Node.js with Express or Nest.js for building APIs.
Database: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing user data, route details, and transactions.
Mapping & GPS: Google Maps API or OpenStreetMap for displaying transport locations and routes.
Payment Integration: eSewa, Khalti APIs for ticket booking and payments.
WebSockets: Use Socket.io for real-time updates and notifications.
